# Android Basics Nanodegree by Google - My 10 Projects
If you were wondering if it's worth it to enroll to the Android Basics Nanodegree by Google, this repository might help you decide.
My answer is: absolutely yes! From zero to hero. In those 6 months you get familiar with the basics of android development and in the end you find yourself building your own apps. 

Topics covered in the Nanodegree program: 
- **User Interface** - You will learn how to build nice screens, layouts according to standards, so your apps will look good
- **User Input** - You will learn how to make your apps interactive.
- **MultiScreen Apps** - The more screen you have, the more possibilities you discover. You will learn about switching among different screens, activities and fragments. 
- **Networking** - There are a huge amount of available API-s all over the internet, with the help of them you can build apps with dynamic content. You will learn about HTTP requests, JSON Parsing and threads,
- **Data Storage** - You have the data, but without storing it, you lose them. You learn about storing data with the help of SQLite

These are te 10 projects I completed during the 6 month Android Basics Nanodegree by Google Scholarship:

## #1 Build a Single Screen App
**Project Description:** Design and implement a simple app that displays information about a small business.  
**Android Tags:** *#userinterface*  
**Personal Comment:** *I built a single screen app for my mother's hand-decorated gingerbread business.*

## #2 Score Keeper App
**Project Description:** Implement an app to track scores between two teams within a game.  
**Android Tags:** *#userinput #animation*  
**Personal Comment:** *This was the app I had the most fun building. I just could not stop improving it through iterations. It started as a boxing score tracker, but at one point I felt that I really needed to shake it up a bit, so I generally reskinned the app. I was so excited that I even made a promo video for it, check it out below.*

## #3 Quiz App
**Project Description:** Design and implement a short quiz app about some topic you are familiar with.  
**Android Tags:** *#listview*
**Personal Comment:** *Nothing special, a quiz app with a ListView and some simple logic under the hood. This was my first time I imported a library. I used [Fancybuttons by medyo](https://github.com/medyo/Fancybuttons)

## #4 Musical Structure App
**Project Description:** Architect the user experience and technical design of an app to play music for a user.  
**Android Tags:** *#multiscreen #intents #arraylist #listview #customclasses*
**Personal Comment:** *My second most beloved project. Although we only had to build the structure of the app, I will definitely contiue developing this one to full functionality. I know looks a bit like spotify, right? Except, blue is much cooler than green ;)*

## #5 Report Card 
**Project Description:** Create a custom Java class to model the information in a student report card.  
**Android Tags:** *#customclass*
**Personal Comment:** *Building a UI wa not the part of this assigment, so no screens are added here. The point was to create a custom java class which comes very handy when building apps.*

## #6: Tour Guide App
**Project Description:** Create an app to guide a user around a city or location of your choice!  
**Android Tags:** *#multiscreen #listview #navigationdrawer*
**Personal Comment:** *4 different lists, a navigation drawer and my favorite places in my hometown Debrece. You're welcome to visit my lovely city any time, again just drop me a line on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gyorgyszabo/) :) *

## #7: Book Listing App
Create an app to list the published books on a given topic using the Google Books API.  
**Android Tags:** *#jsonparsing #HTTPnetworking #threads #parallelism #recyclerview* 
**Personal Comment** *I, myself am not much of a reader, but this was the first time I fetched data from the net. It was a blast to see, when I got it work.*

## #8: News App
**Project Description:** Create an app to display recent news stories on a topic of your choice using a web API.  
**Android Tags:** *#jsonparsing #HTTPnetworking #threads #parallelism #recyclerview*
**Personal Comment** *This project was pretty similar to the book listing app, making the preferences work was a real challenge.

## #9: Habit Tracker App
**Project Description:** Create an app to track your habits.  
**Android Tags:** *#sqlite #contractclass #cursor*
**Personal Comment** *Again, this was a limited functionality app like the Report Card app, to learn the essentials of data storage and how sqlite tables work. 


## #10: Inventory App
**Project Description:** Create an app to track the inventory of a retail store, including current stock and supplier information.  
**Android Tags:** *#sqlite #contractclass #cursor #contentprovider#cursorloader*
**Personal Comment** *If someone would have told me when I started, that I'm going to build an app of this complexity in 6 months, I would not have believed him. Two completely different screens interacting with each other, storing the data given in in the SQLite database. The only app I needed to submit 3 times to meet the requirements. It was hard, but awesome.
