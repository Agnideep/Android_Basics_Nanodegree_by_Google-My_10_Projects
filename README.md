# Android Basics Nanodegree by Google - My 10 Projects
If you were wondering if it's worth it to enroll to the Android Basics Nanodegree by Google, this repository might help you you decide.
If you ask me, my answer is: absolutely yes! From zero to hero. In these 6 months you get familiar with the basics of android development and in the end you find yourself building your own apps. 

Topics covered in the Nanodegree program: 
- **User Interface** - You will learn how to build nice screens, layouts according to standards, so your apps will look good
- **User Input** - You will learn how to make your apps interactive.
- **MultiScreen Apps** - The more screen you have, the more possibilities you discover. You will learn about switching among different screens, activities and fragments. 
- **Networking** - There are a huge amount of available API-s all over the internet, with the help of them you can build apps with dynamic content. You will learn about HTTP requests, JSON Parsing and threads,
- **Data Storage** - You have the data, but without storing it, you lose them. You learn about storing data with the help of SQLite
